Biodiesel Calculator (Palmolein & Popular Oils)

A simple CustomTkinter GUI application that helps calculate the required amounts of alcohol and catalyst for biodiesel production from different oils.  
This project is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates how chemistry concepts (molar ratios, densities, catalyst percentages) can be applied in a Python GUI.

---

✨ Features
- Choose oil type from a list of popular oils (Palmolein, Soybean, Sunflower, Coconut, Olive).
- Select catalyst (NaOH or KOH).
- Select alcohol (Methanol or Ethanol).
- Enter oil amount (ml) and instantly calculate:
  - Required alcohol (ml)
  - Required catalyst (g)
- Dark theme with large, readable text (font size 36 everywhere).
- Compact and user-friendly interface.

🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- customtkinter  
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

Install dependencies with:
`bash
pip install customtkinter
`

---

🚀 Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the script:
   `bash
   python biodiesel_calculator.py
   `
3. Enter the oil amount in milliliters.
4. Choose oil type, catalyst, and alcohol from dropdown menus.
5. Click Calculate to see the required amounts.

📖 Example
If you enter 100 ml Palmolein oil, choose NaOH as catalyst and Methanol as alcohol,  
the calculator will display something like:

`
Alcohol: 21.45 ml
Catalyst: 1.38 g

🎯 Educational Purpose
This app is intended for students and hobbyists learning about biodiesel production.  
It simplifies the chemistry calculations into a visual, interactive tool.

📌 Notes
- All oil molar masses are approximated to 885 g/mol for simplicity.
- Catalyst percentages are set to 1.5% for NaOH and 1.2% for KOH.
- This is not intended for industrial use, only for learning and demonstration.
